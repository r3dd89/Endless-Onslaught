# Endless Onslaught

**Endless Onslaught** is a wave-based first-person shooter (FPS) game set in a warehouse environment. The objective of the game is to survive against increasingly difficult waves of enemies, testing the player's shooting skills and strategic thinking.

## Project Concept

In *Endless Onslaught*, you control a character from a first-person perspective. The player navigates through a warehouse filled with obstacles and enemy spawn points. The goal is to eliminate as many enemies as possible while surviving through as many waves as you can.
